# FAKE-CAMERA

## You can use it as your virtul camera in Tencent Meeting or Zoom.

## Why I write it? 
You know, we all encounter situations where it's inconvenient to open our cameras during online classes. We can't guarantee that it's always feasible. For instance, your roommate might unexpectedly show up nearly naked in front of your camera, or you might be on a train or in some unusual circumstances. I created this repo to assist people in avoiding embarrassing moments.

## What you need is Python and OBS Studio.

There are various ways to obtain a Python environment. For detailed instructions, I recommend searching the internet for the method that suits your needs.

As for OBS Studio, you can find it on Steam. To download Steam, visit the [link ↗](https://store.steampowered.com/about/), install the application, and create an account. Once you're logged in, you can browse the Steam shop and download OBS Studio for free.

## How to use the code

To set up the environment for the "fake-camera" project, follow these three steps:

1、Firstly, git this rep or download as a zip format.
```
git clone https://github.com/kylinhx/fake-camera.git

cd fake-camera
```

2、Secondly, replace the videos in the "video" folder with your own video files.


3、Thirdly, open the project in a terminal (make sure you are in your Python environment) and install the required dependencies using pip:
```
pip install pyvirtualcam opencv-python
```

Next, open the "camera_fake.py" file in your code editor and modify the width and height values to match your own video dimensions. Once you've made the necessary changes, you can run the "camera_fake.py" file. After running it, open Tencent Meeting or Zoom to see what happened to your camera.
